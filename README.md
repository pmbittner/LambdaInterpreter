# Small Interpreter For Lambda Calculus

So far it handles pure lambda calculus only.

_lambda x. T_ can be written as `\x. T`.

You can define aliases to substitute as 

    name := term;
    
where `name` is the name of you alias and `term` is its body.

For examples, please head to [LambdaInterpreter/res/samples](https://github.com/PaulAtTUBS/LambdaInterpreter/tree/master/LambdaInterpreter/res/samples).
